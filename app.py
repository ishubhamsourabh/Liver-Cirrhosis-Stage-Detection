        ## Stage 1: Compensated Cirrhosis
        **Description**:
        - Compensated cirrhosis is the early stage of liver cirrhosis where the liver still functions well despite some damage. At this stage, the liver has the ability to compensate for the damage.
        
        **Symptoms**:
        - Fatigue
        - Mild abdominal pain or discomfort
        - Slight enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly)
        
        **Diagnosis**:
        - Liver function tests show minor alterations.
        - Imaging may show early scarring.
        
        **Affects**:
        - Minimal liver damage.
        - The liver can still perform its essential functions, like detoxifying blood and producing bile.
        - The patient may not experience any noticeable symptoms.

        **Precautions**:
        - Regular liver function monitoring.
        - Avoid alcohol, drugs, and other substances that could harm the liver.
        - Maintain a balanced, nutritious diet.
        - Weight management is crucial to prevent additional stress on the liver.
        
        **Lifestyle Recommendations**:
        - Exercise regularly to help maintain a healthy weight and prevent fat buildup in the liver.
        - Vaccinations for hepatitis A and B are essential, as the liver is more vulnerable at this stage.
        - Limit alcohol intake to minimize further damage.
        
        **Medical Interventions**:
        - No immediate need for medical treatment in this stage.
        - Regular follow-ups with a hepatologist (liver specialist) to monitor liver health.

        **Risk of Progression**:
        - If lifestyle changes are not implemented, or if alcohol consumption continues, this stage can progress to decompensated cirrhosis (Stage 2).

        report = """
        ## Stage 2: Decompensated Cirrhosis
        **Description**:
        - Decompensated cirrhosis occurs when the liver starts to lose its ability to function properly. Complications such as fluid retention (ascites) and jaundice appear, and the liver may no longer be able to compensate for the damage.
        
        **Symptoms**:
        - Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
        - Ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen)
        - Swelling in the legs (edema)
        - Fatigue and weakness
        - Loss of appetite
        
        **Diagnosis**:
        - Blood tests reveal abnormal liver function, elevated bilirubin, and low albumin.
        - Imaging studies show more severe liver damage with the presence of ascites.
        
        **Affects**:
        - Liver function begins to decline significantly, and complications such as fluid retention become more apparent.
        - The liver struggles to detoxify the body, resulting in a buildup of toxins in the blood.
        - A risk of bleeding due to low platelets and impaired clotting.

        **Precautions**:
        - Strict monitoring of liver function through blood tests and imaging.
        - Dietary modifications to manage ascites and other symptoms.
        - Diuretics may be prescribed to help manage fluid retention.
        
        **Lifestyle Recommendations**:
        - Avoid alcohol completely to reduce the risk of further liver damage.
        - Regular physical activity can help manage fluid buildup.
        - A low-salt diet to help control ascites and reduce fluid retention.
        
        **Medical Interventions**:
        - Medications such as diuretics to reduce ascites.
        - Endoscopic treatment for variceal bleeding (if bleeding occurs).
        - Possible consideration for liver transplantation evaluation if the condition worsens.
        
        **Risk of Progression**:
        - If the liver‚Äôs function continues to decline and complications worsen, the patient could progress to end-stage cirrhosis (Stage 3).

        report = """
        ## Stage 3: End-Stage Cirrhosis
        **Description**:
        - End-stage cirrhosis is the final stage of liver cirrhosis, where the liver is severely damaged and no longer capable of performing its vital functions. At this stage, the liver's inability to function properly leads to life-threatening complications.
        
        **Symptoms**:
        - Severe jaundice and skin discoloration
        - Ascites and edema (swelling)
        - Severe fatigue and weakness
        - Confusion or memory problems due to hepatic encephalopathy
        - Bleeding due to impaired blood clotting
        
        **Diagnosis**:
        - Advanced liver failure as indicated by liver function tests.
        - Imaging shows extensive scarring, large amounts of ascites, and possible liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma).
        
        **Affects**:
        - Complete liver failure with a severe loss of liver function.
        - Hepatic encephalopathy (confusion and cognitive issues) may develop due to toxins building up in the blood.
        - Risk of spontaneous bleeding and infection due to clotting issues and immune suppression.
        
        **Precautions**:
        - Strict medical supervision is essential.
        - Consideration for liver transplant evaluation due to the severe loss of liver function.
        - Treatment of complications like infections, bleeding, and ascites.
        
        **Lifestyle Recommendations**:
        - At this stage, the primary focus is on managing complications and maintaining quality of life.
        - Nutritional support to improve overall health and strengthen the immune system.
        - Avoid alcohol and any substances that further stress the liver.
        
        **Medical Interventions**:
        - Liver transplant evaluation is often required as the liver‚Äôs ability to regenerate is no longer present.
        - Medications to manage hepatic encephalopathy and reduce complications.
        - Frequent hospital visits to manage ascites, variceal bleeding, and infections.
        
        **Risk of Progression**:
        - Without a liver transplant or effective management of complications, the patient may face life-threatening outcomes within a short period.
